/**
 * Authentication method used to sign or to verify requests.
 *
 * All implementation have two use cases:
 *
 *  - **Authentication:**
 *    Using the {@see authenticate()} method,
 *    outbound requests can be authenticated.
 *    The method calculates the authentication data for the request
 *    (such as a signature or a id+secret header)
 *    and returns it as additional headers to be added to the request before sending it.
 *
 *  - **Verification:**
 *    Using the {@see verify()} method,
 *    an inbound request's authentication header(s)
 *    can be tested against the rest of the request data (including the client ID)
 *    and the locally-known list of acceptable client IDs and their API secrets.
 *
 * There's also a {@see getClientId()} method that just extracts the API client identification from a request
 * in case you need it for authorization checking/rate limiting/logging.
 *
 * NB:
 *  It's not recommended to use the interface methods directly.
 *  Use the {@see RequestAuthenticator} and {@see RequestVerifier} helper classes instead.
