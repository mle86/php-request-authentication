This PHP library provides a generic interface for authenticating outbound API requests
and for verifying inbound API requests' authentication.

It is released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


## Installation:

Via Composer:  `$ composer require mle86/request-authentication`

Or insert this into your project's `composer.json` file:

```js
"require": {
    "mle86/request-authentication": "^0"
}
```


## Minimum PHP version:

PHP 7.1


## Workflow:

This library contains several [AuthenticationMethod] classes.

Each of those represents one mechanism for request authentication and verification.
The [BasicAuthenticationMethod] for example adds an `Authorization: Basic â€¦` HTTP header to outbound requests
and verifies that header in inbound requests against a list of known usernames and their passwords.

Usually the [AuthenticationMethod] classes won't be used directly
(apart from instantiating them),
there's the [RequestAuthenticator] and [RequestVerifier] wrapper classes instead
that take an AuthenticationMethod dependency.

To sign/authenticate an outbound request
you'll need an [AuthenticationMethod] instance
wrapped in a [RequestAuthenticator] instance,
a client ID and a client secret,
and the request to sign.
The `authenticate()` method will add the required authentication methods to the request
so that it can be sent.

To verify an inbound request
you'll need an [AuthenticationMethod] instance of the same class
wrapped in a [RequestVerifier] instance
and a [KeyRepository] that will map the request's client ID
to the same client secret used for signing the request.  
(In case of the [PublicKeyMethod] class,
the client will use its private key for signing
and the [KeyRepository] must return the client's public key.)
